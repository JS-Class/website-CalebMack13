    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>
        In my family is my father Cliff who works at Sauders woodworking as an
        electrician. My mother's name is Pam and she works out of the
        local county hospital. Finaly, my big sister who lives in San Diego
        and works as a paralegal. She is also married to a man named Kevin 
        who works at the local airfield as a aircraft engineer.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p> 
        When not working on college work or working in general I fill 
        my time with my hobbies. Playing video games with friends is somthing 
        I enjoy. Video games are what inspired me to try and build my first ever 
        computer. This also lead me to try emmulating older games on my small 
        raspberry pi. I also enjoy watching movies and reading fiction.
    </p>

    <h3>Job</h3>

        I currently work at J&B Feed Company in my hometown. At the company

        I make several tons of feed and deliver it to local farms and ranches.
        We are also provide feed for animals at the <em>Toledo Zoo</em>.
