    <Main>
        
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
            In my family is my father Cliff who works at Sauders woodworking as an
            electrician. My mother's name is Pam and she works out of the 
            local county hospital. Finally, my big sister who lives in San Diego,
            California works as a paralegal. She is also married to a man named 
            Kevin who works at the local airfield as a aircraft engineer.   
        </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p> 
            When not working on college work or working in general I fill 
            my time with my hobbies. Playing video games with friends is somthing 
            I enjoy. Video games are what inspired me to try and build my first ever 
            computer. This also lead me to try emmulating older games on my small 
            raspberry pi. I also enjoy watching movies and reading fiction.
        </p>
